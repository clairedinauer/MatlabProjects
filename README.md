# Matlab Projects

Here, you can find projects I created using Matlab. Descriptions of each project are below.

## JudgmentOfLearning Folder
This contains my final project for my advanced Matlab course, in which I created a psychology-based experiment.

I conducted literature review to curate a project exploring how people make predictions and judge their own learning abilities, specifically with an emphasis on how well people *think* they can remember things versus how well they can *actually* remember things. I combined prior psychology research on Judgments of Learning (JOL) and the Serial Position Effect to investigate how people may (or may not) adjust their JOLs based on their knowledge of the Serial Position Effect.
